## Hi, I’m Kshitij

I build **accessibility-first products**—currently **software for smart glasses** that helps **blind and low-vision people** move through the world more independently. With **18 years** in mobile engineering, I’ve shipped production apps end-to-end, led teams through scale, and built systems that keep quality high as velocity increases.

**Snapshot**

* Engineering Manager at **Envision AI** (smart glasses + assistive tech)
* Shipped Android apps with **500K+ downloads**
* Led multi award-winning accessibility apps, including **Google Play “Best Accessibility App”** and multiple **AppleVis** awards

---

## Now

I’m an **Engineering Manager at Envision AI**, building software for smart glasses for the blind and low-vision community. My work sits at the intersection of **engineering leadership and product execution**: clarifying outcomes, aligning teams, and ensuring we ship reliably.

In parallel, I also consult with early-stage startups to strengthen engineering foundations:

* engineering systems (guidelines, architecture patterns, review standards)
* delivery health (process, planning, release discipline)
* developer training and mentorship
