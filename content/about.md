Hi, I’m Kshitij. I build fast, reliable web experiences and the tooling that keeps them healthy. My recent work focuses on:

- Edge-rendered sites on Cloudflare Workers and Pages
- Design systems with accessibility and performance baked in
- Observability pipelines that shorten feedback loops for product teams

I like tight feedback cycles, automated checks, and clear runbooks. If you want to collaborate on a project or need help tuning a stack, reach out at [hello@funkyidol.in](mailto:hello@funkyidol.in).
