## Hi, I'm Kshitij Aggarwal

I build **accessibility first products**. I lead **software for smart glasses** that helps **blind and low vision people** move through the world more independently. With more than **18 years** of experience in mobile engineering and consulting, I align business goals with technical execution, scale mobile teams, and ship production apps end to end.

Since **December 2018**, I have been leading mobile engineering initiatives at **Envision AI** across **Android and iOS apps**, **on device AI integrations** and **smart glasses wearables** that deliver **voice first experiences** at global scale.

**Snapshot**

* Engineering leadership in assistive tech and smart glasses, with on device AI integrations
* Shipped Android apps with **500K+ downloads** and scaled experiences to **3 million+ users** across **180+ countries**
* Led multi award winning accessibility apps, including **Google Play "Best Accessibility App"** and multiple **AppleVis** awards

## Now

I am an **Engineering Manager at Envision AI**, building software for smart glasses for the blind and low vision community. I lead mobile engineering across Android and iOS, on device AI integrations, and voice first wearables, with responsibility for roadmap execution, technical direction, and release quality.

My work sits at the intersection of **engineering leadership and product execution**. I clarify outcomes, align teams, and ensure we ship reliably.

In parallel, I consult with early stage startups to strengthen engineering foundations:

* engineering systems (guidelines, architecture patterns, review standards)
* delivery health (process, planning, release discipline)
* developer training and mentorship
