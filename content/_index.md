## Engineering Manager — smart glasses, accessibility, Android.

{{< lead >}}
I build accessibility-first products—currently software for smart glasses that supports blind and low-vision people. With 18 years in mobile engineering, I focus on systems that let teams ship reliably: clear ownership, modular architecture, strong quality gates, and developer experience that scales.

## What I do now

I’m an Engineering Manager at **Envision AI**, building software for smart glasses for the blind and low-vision community. My work spans engineering leadership and product execution: aligning teams on outcomes, improving delivery health, and keeping accessibility as a baseline—not a late-stage add-on.

---

## Consulting

I work with early-stage teams to strengthen engineering foundations:

- Engineering guidelines (architecture patterns, code review standards, modularization)
- Delivery discipline (planning, release processes, quality gates)
- Developer training and mentorship
- Accessibility-first implementation reviews
