<!--## Current

I am an **Engineering Manager at Envision AI**, building software for smart glasses for the blind and low vision community. I lead mobile engineering across Android and iOS, on device AI integrations, and voice first wearables, with responsibility for roadmap execution, technical direction, and release quality.

My work sits at the intersection of **engineering leadership and product execution**. I clarify outcomes, align teams, and ensure we ship reliably.

In parallel, I consult with early stage startups to strengthen engineering foundations:

* engineering systems (guidelines, architecture patterns, review standards)
* delivery health (process, planning, release discipline)
* developer training and mentorship-->

<!-----

## What I optimize for

* **Ownership:** end to end responsibility, clear interfaces, fewer handoffs
* **Maintainability:** clean, modular code that scales with product complexity
* **Product thinking:** engineering decisions that improve real user outcomes and time to market
* **Accessibility as a baseline:** designed in from day one, validated continuously-->
