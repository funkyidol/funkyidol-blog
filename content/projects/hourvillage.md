**Role:** Engineering Lead

**Summary:**

Hourvillage is a time based marketplace where people exchange skills and services using hours instead of money, aiming to make volunteering and charity work more accessible. I joined as the first engineer and led the product end to end: building the initial LAMP backend, prototyping a cross platform Ionic frontend, and delivering the native Android app for public release. I also established engineering processes and guidelines as the team grew.

**Tech stack:**

* LAMP (Linux, Angular, MySQL, PHP)
* Ionic (hybrid Web/Android/iOS)
* Android (MVVM, Dependency Injection, Android Architecture Components)

**Impact:**

* Led engineering end to end: hiring, processes, and high level architecture across platforms.
* Built the initial backend and cross platform prototypes.
* Shipped the native Android app for public release.
