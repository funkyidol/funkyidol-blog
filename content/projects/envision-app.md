**Role:** Engineering Manager & Lead Developer

**Summary:**

Envision is an accessibility-first mobile app that helps blind and low-vision users read text and understand their surroundings using computer vision and machine learning. As Engineering Manager and Lead Developer, I drive Android execution and ship improvements across document reading and recognition workflows with a TalkBack-first UX focus. The product is available on Android and iOS and localized in 7+ languages, using a mix of on-device and cloud models (e.g., ML Kit, Azure, AWS) depending on the capability.

Also built Envision Glasses. The AI-powered smart eyewear designed to empower blind and low-vision users with hands-free independence. Built on Google Glass, they audibly articulate the world around you—instantly reading text, recognizing faces, and identifying objects or colors. Beyond automated vision, they feature "Ask Envision" to interactively query scanned documents and "Call a Companion" for immediate video support from friends or family.

**Tech stack:**

* Android (Kotlin + Compose UI)
* MVI + Clean Architecture
* Accessibility-first UX
* Custom LLM + tool orchestration

**Impact:**

* Shipped and evolved core accessibility-first flows for reading and visual assistance.
