**Role:** Mobile Developer

**Summary:**

A white-label social media aggregator that unified feeds from multiple networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and enabled cross-posting from a single interface. I built the core integration and publishing experience and helped package it into a reusable template for multiple client-branded apps. The emphasis was consistent functionality with distinct look-and-feel per customer.

**Tech stack:**

* Android
* Social platform integrations (feed aggregation + cross-posting)
* White-label app architecture

**Impact:**

* Built an app aggregating feeds from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and more.
* Enabled users to post to multiple social platforms from one place.
* Delivered as part of a white-label suite with shared functionality and distinct branding.
