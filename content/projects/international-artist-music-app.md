**Role:** Mobile Developer

**Summary:**

Built as part of a white-label suite for international music artists, this Android app delivered both streaming playback and local audio support. I implemented key music features such as playlists, seeking, and notification media controls, while ensuring the app could be skinned and reused across multiple client releases. The focus was a polished, performant media experience.
